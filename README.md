# Ninefold CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ninefold/cli.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ninefold/cli) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ninefold/cli.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ninefold/cli)

This package is the official ninefold.com CLI. The Ninefold CLI allows you to access the rails console, logging, run rake tasks, and more. 

## Installation

You can install this CLI with the usual `gem install` command

    gem install ninefold


## Usage

Start with

    ninefold signin

And enter your credentials for the `ninefold` portal.

Then run the following to get the list of the `app` related commands

    ninefold app help

## Updates

Ninefold frequently updates the CLI with new features. Before running the CLI, we recommend that you update your version of the gem. 

	gem update ninefold

## Binding An App

If you run any of the `ninefold app` commands from your rails app root
folder and the app's git url will match the one you picked from the apps
list during the command run, ninefold CLI will create the `.ninefold`
file in your app root folder.

Once that happened, the CLI will know which app it is working with and
won't ask you to pick an app from the list again.

If you don't need this binding anymore, you can safely delete this file.
